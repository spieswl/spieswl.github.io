I started getting into the trend of recording more data about myself in 2020, and one way that trend has manifested itself is through the recording of my reading habits.
An example in an image:

<div class="post-image">

Teal corresponds to a non-fiction book, while orange is a fiction book.
You can tell exactly when I joined up with my wife's book reading club in the middle of the year.
For each of the books featured in the chart above, I wrote a short review further down this post.
I do not intend to start a book review channel or anything of that sort, but this does present another chance to practice my creative writing.
If my musings on each book convince you to read (or not read, but hopefully the former) a particular book, then I consider that to be a bonus!

#### The Guns at Last Light (by Rick Atkinson)

This is the third book in a Nonfiction trilogy detailing the experiences of the Allied armies and navies starting from the North African invasion until V-E day.
_The Guns at Last Light_ begins with the planning of Operation Overlord, the codename for the Allied invasion of Normandy, France.
The way that Atkinson retells the experiences of the commanders and leaders, of the officers, and of the front-line troops is phenomenal.
I could not get enough of the detail that was painstakingly included in this book.
While I could not help feeling that the Allied victory was a formality (an artifact of hindsight and knowing history), the focus on valor and heroism, on international political dealings in matters of warfare, and on what this meant to the participating nations brought this subject to life in a way I have not experienced before.
All-in-all, a long read, but this one will stick with me for a while. I started reading this trilogy back in 2019 so I did not review the first two books (*An Army at Dawn*, *The Day of Battle*).
However, if you are a history buff like I am, I highly recommend all three books.

#### The End is Always Near (by Dan Carlin)

Another nonfiction book by Dan Carlin, of [Hardcore History](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/) and [Common Sense](https://www.dancarlin.com/product-category/common-sense-with-dan-carlin/) fame.
Dan's writing style closely matches his speaking style, which I adore in a podcast format, but this seems less than ideal for a book.
I love the essential content of the book, which consists of cursory analyses of plagues (topical), catastrophes, societal collapses, and of the people who experienced each of these things.
Each chapter is a distillation of topics brought up over the course of his Hardcore History podcast, so *The End is Always Near* is a solid book for getting introduced to Dan's interests and style, but I thought it bears a few too many digressions for my taste.
Overall, an enjoyable book for someone who likes asking "what ifs" when talking about historical events, but feel free to pass on it otherwise.

#### Deacon King Kong (by James McBride)

The first of many fiction books I read throughout 2020; this stayed among my favorites.
This read was initially overwhelming with the number of characters McBride throws at you, but the writing style and scene setting is wonderfully handled.
It was a bit of a slow burn to get invested, but I could not put down the book once I reached the latter half.
This is a beautiful, character-driven story about a tough group of people enduring a tough time in society.
I thought the ending seemed a little short, and even anti-climactic in some aspects, but the resolution was emotionally satisfying and moving.
I am not surprised this showed up on many "Top Reads" lists in 2020.
A solid book and one that I highly recommend.

#### The Nature of the Beast (by Louise Penny)

Another series book, this mystery-thriller is another in a set of stories about Armand Gamache, former Chief Inspector of Homicide in Quebec.
The primary plot driver here is loosely based on the real-life development of an experimental superweapon, [Project Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Babylon).
Having not read any prior books in the Gamache series, I nevertheless found him a familiar and enjoyable character.
One of his literary 'cousins', Hercule Poirot, perhaps helped contribute to this feeling of familiarity.
Louise Penny does a good job with the interesting managerie of characters surrounding Gamache, but the plot of this one is a little pulpy for my taste and borders on the ridiculous at times (even for a thriller).
A decent read and a suitable pallate cleanser, but ultimately does not inspire me to read the others in Penny's *Armand Gamache* series.

#### The Road (by Cormac McCarthy)

A legendary book that I thoroughly despised reading.
Cormac McCarthy does a phenomenal job with the writing in this book; the limited vernacular and turns of phrase he used felt entirely appropriate for the post-apocalyptic setting.
The relationship between the man and the boy was beautifully represented, and I felt that their shared journey was inspiring.
It may be surprising, then, when I say that I had no joy in reading about the experience of people on the other side of nuclear apocalypse.
There were some wonderful moments in the story, and McCarthy does a fantastic job of slowly revealing the nature of the world around our protagonists.
Just read it when times are better and you may come away with fonder memories of it than I did.

#### Breakfast of Champions (by Kurt Vonnegut)

A Vonnegut classic.
The premise is simple and silly, but what was really striking about this book was the myriad ways in which Vonnegut critiques American society.
Equal parts dark, light, satirical, and deadly serious, this book took my sensibilities on a rollercoaster ride until I finally settled on the conclusion that this is an excellent book.
Fantastic imagery abounds in this book, although what is being pictured is often cynical, uncomfortable, or piercing.
I could have easily felt the same negative way about *Breakfast of Champions* as I did about *The Road*, but the fantastical nature of Vonnegut's story tipped the balance in favor of this being an uncomfortable, yet poignant read.
I recommend it, but warn that you might not walk away from this book with a good feeling, although you will most certainly be amused.

#### Good Omens (by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman)

This was my favorite book of the year.
The end of the world theme that coursed through the prior two readings was humourously turned on its head for *Good Omens*, and I thought that the resulting story was terrific on account.
Each of the characters were humorous, creatively-realized (I thought *Famine* was particularly clever), and enjoyable to follow.
The plotline to avert Armageddeon is expertly handled.
There were no moments I can recall where it was obvious that there were two authors working on this story, yet I still felt there were distinctively "Gaiman-esque" or "Pratchett-esque" aspects sprinkled throughout the book.
I have read a number of works by Neil Gaiman before, so I was already expecting good things, but this is the first of Pratchett's works that I have experienced.
This book was so much fun to read that I now plan on checking out Pratchett's other writings at some point, as well as redoubling my efforts to read more from Gaiman.
*Good Omens* comes highly recommended, and **especially** if you are looking for a way to cast off 2020.

### The Lovely Bones (by Alice Sebold)

A simultaneously crushing and hope-filled story.
The beginning of this one is ROUGH, as it depicts a rape-murder of the narrator.
If you can get through that, what follows is a beautiful account of people reconciling their own lives in the wake of an earth-shattering event.
I felt a sense of closeness with the people in this story; a credit to Alice Sebold's skill at making these characters feel human.
Where I really felt this book suffered was during its ending.
I put this book away having felt mostly satisfied at the arcs of all the characters, but I do not feel particulaly connected to the message and meanings.
In one sense, this is a story about getting closure, but the sense of closure I felt at the end could be best described as superficial.
I certainly sensed changes in the tempo of the story, and while I doubt I'll go back and read it again (if only to avoid that ghastly first chapter), the setting felt detailed and rewards the observant reader.
Overall, I enjoyed *The Lovely Bones*, but if you have more sensitive or discerning tastes, or are picky about your endings, feel free to pass on this one.

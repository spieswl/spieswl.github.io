My first term at Northwestern University involved taking a number of courses intended to quickly familiarize students with advanced concepts in robotics, such as computer vision, robotic manipulation (understanding and implementing kinematic and dynamic control of robotic systems), embedded systems, and other areas. Part of the final evaluation of [Dr. Kevin Lynch](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/lynch-kevin.html)'s Robotic Manipulation course involved demonstrating the application of our accumulated knowledge to a problem involving a Kuka YouBot in an interactive simulation running in Coppelia Robotics' **[VREP](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/)**.

We were given the initial conditions for the [Kuka YouBot](http://www.youbot-store.com/developers/) (position, orientation, and arm joint angles) and tasked with getting the YouBot to follow a pre-defined end-effector trajectory over a five second timespan. In order to successfully meet the requirements for this evaluation, we needed to have implemented kinematic control of the 5-DOF robotic arm, use odometry to gauge and control the position and orientation of the mechanum-wheeled chassis, and integrate a PI controller to take the robot's deviation from the desired path into account.

The controller was entirely written in Python, and uses the _numpy_ and _Modern Robotics_ libraries to implement feed-forward, proportional, and proportional-integral control. For those unfamiliar with the _Modern Robotics_ library, this library includes a number of highly useful functions designed to simplify the writing of manipulation and control code for arbitrary robotic systems. For example, functions are available which take a particular robot's screw axes at a given joint configuration and return the Space or Body Jacobians for that configuration. The controller takes the results of all these calculations over the entire time span and outputs each of the joint coordinates, chassis coordinates, and wheel coordinates to a CSV file. A particular scene available in VREP (built with the YouBot as its focus) can take the full list of time varying joint angles and play back the motion of the robot, seen below in the animated GIF. Results for the error feedback components are also included for both the "P-"" and "PI-control" cases.

This code is not available at this moment for academic integrity purposes; as far as I know, this project has been used multiple years in a row in Kevin's Robotic Manipulation class. To shield future students from potential academic impropriety, this code will not be made available on GitHub until that changes. However, I can speak at length with those who have commercial or industrial interests about the Python code written for this project. As usual, check the **[About](https://spieswl.github.io/about)** page for the relevant contact information!

Every now and then, it can be fun to tackle otherwise straightforward or simple problems with the intention of seeing what you can do.

As part of our introductory Computer Vision course at Northwestern, a [fellow colleague](https://github.com/laurenhut/) and I teamed up to create a "Smart" eraser program using **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** and **[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)**. Our program works by using some simple image processing techniques on each frame of a sampled video feed. For each frame, we identified red foreground handwriting against a background texture of printed words, erase the foreground handwriting based on the position of an 'eraser' cursor (in this case, a marker held near the top of the frame), and synthesize a new texture for the erased regions that blends in with the background paper.

The "Smart" eraser program we developed operates on an AVI-format video file, using built-in `OpenCV` functionality as seen here:

```python
import cv2
import imageTiling
import numpy as np
import os
import sys

...

# Define the working path for the target video file, based on input 'videoFile'
vid_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) + "/" + videoFile
vid_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(vid_path)

# Read first frame from the video feed
frame_firstImage = vid_capture.read()[1]

...
```

We made some assumptions at the start of development that greatly simplified our path forward:

1. ***We can identify (and, later, mask) the text by setting threshold values for pixels matching HSV values corresponding with red text.***
2. ***The text being erased does not move throughout the video, so the original mask is valid for the duration of the video.***
3. ***Erasing as little of the background texture as possible, while potentially making our texture synthesis more difficult, is preferable to preserve the integrity of the rest of the video.***

Our solution was split into two components: one component (`magicEraser.py`) handled by myself and one component (`imageTiling.py`) handled by my teammate, Lauren. My component handled the parsing of the video feed, identifying and masking the foreground text, and passing the "masked" image to Lauren's Python script. The following text is one part of the few functions required to identify, mask, and pass on the processed image from any arbitrary frame of the video:

```python
...

def eraseTextWithMask(frame_BGR, frame_HSV, mask, replacement_texture):

    # Define frame height and width boundaries
    frame_height = frame_BGR.shape[0]  # Nominally 240
    frame_width = frame_BGR.shape[1]   # Nominally 320

    # Initialize important mask variables
    frame_wandXCoord = 0
    kernel = np.ones((3,3), np.uint8)

    # HSV boundary ranges for "Red" (NOTE: Slightly different than original mask boundary values)
    mask_redLowerBound = np.array([0,0,0])
    mask_redUpperBound = np.array([20,255,255])

    # Use OpenCV function to generate red image mask
    frame_redMask = cv2.inRange(frame_HSV, mask_redLowerBound, mask_redUpperBound)

    # Erode and dilate the text mask until general enough to cover the marker text
    frame_erodedMask = cv2.erode(frame_redMask, kernel, iterations=1)
    frame_dilatedMask = cv2.dilate(frame_erodedMask, kernel, iterations=5)

    # Identify the location of the cursor based on the x-coordinate of the Red tip
    # The "break" statements are required to eject from the nested "for" loops when finding the first non-zero value
    for j in range(frame_height):
        for k in range(frame_width):
            if frame_dilatedMask[j][k] == 255:
                frame_wandXCoord = k

            if frame_wandXCoord != 0:
                break
            else:
                continue

        if frame_wandXCoord != 0:
            break
        else:
            continue

    # Set up occlusion masks for important areas to ignore as part of the texture tiling setup
    for m in range(frame_height):
        for n in range(frame_width):

            # Replace all text to the right of the marker tip with the white "screen"
            if n >= frame_wandXCoord and mask[m][n] == 255:
                frame_BGR[m][n] = replacement_texture[m][n]

    return frame_BGR

...
```

Some challenges we identified along the way:

1. ***There were regions we absolutely needed to prevent our texture synthesizer from pulling from to ensure that we could blend the new texture with the background texture.***
2. ***The video feed we were given was very noisy. Morphological operations on the image were required to trim out noise and restore key areas for the masking and cursor-search operations.***
3. ***Our initial design only included functionality to develop one synthesized 'tile' that ends up going everywhere. You can clearly see texture similarities in the final product.***

The easiest way to show how our solution progressed is to pull up the input, intermediate results, and final output for an example frame of the video. White regions in the frame represent 'erased' text that needs to be filled in, while blue regions represent areas where we prevented the script from pulling samples from.

We ended up with a fairly clean solution; one we are both relatively pleased with. Of course, the utility of a program that can do simplistic texture replacement on one single video source is extraordinarily low, but we learned a good deal about video and image processing, applying `OpenCV` functions, and ended up getting some practice with standard computer vision tasks. The project code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/spieswl/magic-eraser), as well as the documentation and images supporting our result, but beyond some post-presentation clean-up, we will probably not be changing aspects of this project in the future.

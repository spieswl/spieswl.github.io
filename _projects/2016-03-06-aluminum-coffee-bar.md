One of the benefits of working for an automation supplier is getting to see how things in the industrial realm are built. My experience at **ATS** was that we routinely produced things of great quality across the mechanical, electrical, and software spectrum. While part of that was my job as an electrical and systems engineer, I also got to see first-hand how the tooling, framing, fixtures, and gantries were designed and built. One of the raw materials we used most often is known as extruded aluminum, or extrusion as we liked to call it. Manufactured by companies such as **[80/20 Inc.](https://8020.net/)** and **[Bosch Rexroth](https://www.boschrexroth.com/en/us/products/product-groups/assembly-technology/topics/aluminum-structural-framing/index)**, extrusion often served as structural material, machine guarding, architectural components, or as a platform for mounting devices and fixtures. I often liked to joke that we were the biggest consumer of extruded aluminum in Ohio, and that may not have been too far from the truth in 2015 and 2016. Extruded aluminum gets a lot of use in industrial applications due to its lightweight nature (from the aluminum itself and its unique geometry), high strength-to-weight ratio, and considerable flexibility and utility. While not necessarily the cheapest option for framing out there, the benefits of using extrusion usually outweigh the costs.

I had wanted to use extrusion in custom home furniture for a long time (_I was around the stuff all the time and had access to a huge amount of scrap, why wouldn't I try to use some?_), but the trick was getting my then-girlfriend-and-now-wife to agree to it. The profiles we were using had a clear finish to them (_which is the form most people see when they encounter extruded aluminum_), leaving the silvery color exposed. I agreed with my wife that the standard, silver profiles looked far too industrial to use outside of a workshop or garage, but a breakthrough occurred when I discovered that **80/20** sold a version that comes anodized with a black finish.

I drew up a concept that would use some custom wood pieces and black-anodized extrusion to create a modern-industrial coffee bar. We had recently been looking at "coffee nook" cabinets and furniture to store all our mugs, coffee beans, grinders, presses, and miscellaneous prep ware. Pinterest and Instagram offered many extravagant ideas for a home-made coffee bar design, but instead I designed something a bit more modest:

        <img src="{{ site.url }}/{{ site.assets.projects }}/{{ page.specifics.images }}/02_coffee_bar.jpg" width="480" style="margin:4px 4px 4px 4px">
    </a>

    </a>
</div>

The frame itself used 25mm profiles that can accomodate M6 button-head screws, both in the T-slot channels and in the ends of each piece (after some tapping). I thought that the black finish would be more modern and aesthetically fitting than any of the other styles; something I confirmed when they were finally in-hand. The dimensions of the frame itself, 40″W x 34″H x 18″D, allowed for a standard, birch, ‘butcher block’ tabletop (_from Menards_) to be mounted on the top of the stand after cutting one of the ends down. In lieu of a stain or urethane coating, I treated the butcher block top with a beeswax-infused mineral oil to provide protection that is also food-safe. Two shelves, also made from birch, were trimmed and mounted on the inside of the frame, supported by black aluminum gussets. These shelves allow for plenty of storage space for ceramics and glassware inside the frame. Leveling feet are installed in tapped holes on the bottom of the extrusion, which can be later replaced by casters, if I ever care to splurge on them.

The unique structure of extruded aluminum extrusion allows me to brace the cross-members with gussets, tap the ends to screw other fixtures into place, or bore through the center to secure and suspend materials at a perpendicular angle to the aluminum profile. The downsides to using extrusion, like most any other metal framing material, come from the cost and from the difficulty in working with the material. That said, if you have a drill and a sawblade capable of cutting through aluminum, then I recommend at least experimenting with extruded aluminum. I think most people would be surprised at how nice the finished product looks for being made entirely from industrial materials.

The ability to completely disassemble and rebuild our new coffee bar without having to undo wood screws or loosen other fasteners should also prove valuable. The channeled faces allows for attachments to be mounted to the frame without power tools, and accessories like plastic "channel fill" can be inserted to smooth out the look and feel of the frame. If we ever move, I should be able to break the bar into enough pieces that is can be handled similarly to flat-pack. Overall, the coffee bar looks fantastic in our home and the design is flexible, simple, and sleek. The wife is really happy with it, so she gave me the green light to come up with more extrusion-based designs in future furniture projects.

**UPDATE (3/4/2020):** We have moved the coffee bar three times now (_Chicago, back to Columbus, and now to Denver_), and its actually the only piece of furniture we kept from our longer stay in Columbus. This thing is still a fantastic piece of furniture, even four years after I originally built it!

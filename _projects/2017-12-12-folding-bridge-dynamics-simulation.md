At the end of the Fall 2017 term of my graduate studies, I wrote a simulation program in **[Wolfram Mathematica 11](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)** with the intent to try and recreate the dynamics of the Hörn bridge in Kiel, Germany. This bridge is well-known for its elegant design and [unique opening and closing behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BF3Lvmi_8), so I opted to try and recreate the bridge as a project in my Machine Dynamics class. Thanks to its status as a unique feat of bridge engineering, there was some literature available which allowed me to glean some insight into the control and operation of the bridge. From there, it was all coding and evaluation in Mathematica.

The Mathematica project notebook evolved through three different stages:
* **Initial problem setup & physical characterization**
* **Finding the correct constraints on the bridge's operation**
* **Modelling the impact condition and attempting some form of control over the bridge's action**

The final form of the project is an animation of the bridge unfolding under the effects of gravity and experiencing an impact on the far side pylon. I implemented some basic controls, mostly so that the framework would exist should I choose to return later and install a control law sufficient to safely deploy the bridge. As of right now, it can only delay (or accelerate) the opening of the bridge under gravity, which is not enough to prevent a hard collision on the far pylon. For the purposes of getting some meaningful data out of the simulation, I made sure to take a reading of the velocity experienced at the end of the final leaf at the moment of impact. At the moment, the simulated bridge hits far too hard to be considered "safe."

This project, though I am admittedly not an avid Mathematica user, was an incredible amount of fun to work on. For those who would be interested in expanding on the foundations of the dynamic simulation already in place, or those curious to see an example of how I structured the evaluation and animation components, the source code for the project is available on **[GitHub](https://github.com/spieswl/horn-bridge-dynamics_sim)**! Finally, send me a message (check the [About](https://spieswl.github.io/about) page for the administrator's contact information) if you have any comments or questions about the project!

**BONUS:** Here's a GIF of the animation in action.

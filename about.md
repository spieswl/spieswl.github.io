Hello! My name is William Spies, and I make robots!

I currently reside in sunny Colorado, where you can find me doing a whole host of things. I am known by my colleagues for being methodical, practical, supportive, lighthearted, and relentless. I have been lucky to work with many elite movers and shakers in the realm of robotics, all of whom have been a joy to work with!

I originally hail from Cincinnati, Ohio. I graduated from the [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/) in June of 2012 with my **Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering**, accompanied by a minor in Photonics. During my undergraduate career, I spent over a year co-oping at **[L3Harris Cincinnati Electronics](https://www2.l3t.com/ce/)** in the Space Avionics group, where I worked on avionics systems used on [active launch platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Space_Launch) still today. Much of my free time was consumed by serving as part of a partnership between [Habitat for Humanity and the University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/profiles/profile.asp?id=8840), and I took opportunities to show leadership in engineering and community relationship building through the **[University Honors Program](https://www.uc.edu/honors.html)** and the **[Center for Community Engagement](https://www.uc.edu/cce.html)**.

I served from mid-2012 to mid-2017 as a **leading Electrical Design Engineer**, **Systems Programmer**, and **Systems Project Engineer** with **[ATS Automation](https://atsautomation.com/)** in Columbus, Ohio. My project portfolio carries the distinction of delivering custom industrial automation systems currently in use by General Motors, Dow Chemical, TRW Automotive, Oral-B, Tesla Motors, First Solar, and various other corporations. I was given several opportunities to lead controls development on cutting-edge, highly-automated industrial manufacturing lines, and those opportunities served as critical stepping stones on the path to where I find myself today. At the peak of my responsibilities at ATS, I was leading a warm and brilliant team of twelve Systems Programmers with over 100 cumulative years of systems and robot programming experience. I also passed many moments at the **[Columbus Idea Foundry](https://ideafoundry.com/)** and was an active participant in the Columbus swing dancing community, where I met my lovely and wonderful wife.

Towards the end of my time in Columbus, I kicked off my next chapter when I was accepted to and attended Northwestern University's accelerated **[MSR](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/)** program in September of 2017. In September of 2018, I graduated from Northwestern with my **Masters of Science in Robotics** along with a cohort of [nearly two dozen other incredible individuals](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/people/alumni/2017-2018.html). While studying at NU, I specialized in computer vision applications, 3D reconstruction, embedded systems programming *(a.k.a. working in [ROS](https://www.ros.org/))*, and robotic manipulation.

Part of my responsibilites to the **MSR** program led me to join the **[Computational Photography Lab](https://compphotolab.northwestern.edu/)** as a Research Scientist under Dr. Oliver Cossairt. For the several months I worked in the CPL, my main areas of focus involved working alongside Dr. Florian Willomitzer on an improved implementation of [Flying Triangulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4168) and on a novel use of `WebRTC` to facilitate surface measurements of [famous paintings](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2019/02/diagnosing-art-acne-in-georgia-okeeffe-paintings.html?utm_source=northwestern&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mccormick-alumni-enewsletter&utm_content=alumni__03-04-19_) and [stained glass works](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-28-7-9027) using consumer-grade electronic devices *(that's my hand holding the Android tablet in Figure 1a of the Optics Express article)*.

Since 2019 I have been a senior robotics engineer at **[Outrider Technologies](https://www.outrider.ai/)**, working on the incredible **TrailerConnect** system and as a lead software engineer at **[True Anomaly](https://www.trueanomaly.space/)**, writing command-and-control software for their **Mosaic** software product. The opportunity to work on both terrestrial and space robots has been phenomenally enjoyable, and you can find more details of time spent at those companies in the **[Career Retrospectives]()** area. I started my own robotics consulting LLC in 2022, named **Fenris Robotics**, to provide consulting experience to other companies needing assistance across a wide swath of robotic product domains. Some of my experiences with those customers are still work-in-progress, so keep an eye out for blog updates.

When I am not tinkering with robots or working on side projects, you can find me searching for new coffee shops and food spots, trying out a new board game, rock climbing, playing with my dog Luna, looking for interesting places to explore, swing dancing, reading a good book, skiing, 3D printing, or building things in *Factorio*.

Of course, I cannot hope to include everything in just this segment...but pictures may help fill in a few gaps:

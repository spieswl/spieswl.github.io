Hello! My name is William Spies, and I am a **Robotics Software Engineer** at **[Outrider Technologies](https://www.outrider.ai/)** here in sunny Colorado.

I am currently working to bring robotic automation into the realm of logistics and trucking. On a daily basis, you can find me writing C++ and Python code, controlling robotic actuators, working with computer vision systems, and mentoring our newest engineers. I am known among my colleagues for being methodical, practical, supportive, lighthearted, and relentless. I am proud to be a part of an elite team of movers and shakers in the realm of robotics, all of whom are a joy to work with!

My time here at Outrider, however, only represents a brief part of my story so far. I originally hail from Cincinnati, Ohio **\[<small>1</small>\]**. I stayed in Cincinnati and graduated from the [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/) <small>***(GO BEARCATS!)***</small> in June of 2012 with my **Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering**, along with a minor in Photonics. During my undergraduate career, I spent just over a year co-oping at **[L3Harris Cincinnati Electronics](https://www2.l3t.com/ce/)** in the Space Avionics group, where I worked on avionics systems that are used on [active launch platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Space_Launch) still today. Much of my free time was consumed by serving as part of a partnership between [Habitat for Humanity and the University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/profiles/profile.asp?id=8840), and I took opportunities to show leadership in engineering and community relationship building through the **[University Honors Program](https://www.uc.edu/honors.html)** and the **[Center for Community Engagement](https://www.uc.edu/cce.html)**.

After my undergraduate studies, I served from mid-2012 to mid-2017 as a **leading Electrical Design Engineer**, **Systems Programmer**, and **Systems Project Engineer** with **[ATS Automation](https://atsautomation.com/)** in Columbus, Ohio. My project portfolio carries the distinction of delivering custom industrial automation systems currently in use by General Motors, Dow Chemical, TRW Automotive, Oral-B, Tesla Motors, First Solar, and various other corporations. I was given several opportunities to lead controls development on cutting-edge, highly-automated industrial manufacturing lines, and those opportunities served as critical stepping stones on the path to where I find myself today. At the peak of my responsibilities at ATS, I was leading a warm and brilliant team of twelve Systems Programmers with over 100 cumulative years of systems and robot programming experience. I also passed many moments at the **[Columbus Idea Foundry](https://ideafoundry.com/)** **\[<small>2</small>\]** and was an active participant in the Columbus swing dancing community, where I met my lovely and wonderful wife.

Towards the end of my time in Columbus, I kicked off the next chapter of my life by applying to graduate schools around the country. I was accepted to Northwestern University's accelerated **[MSR](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/)** program in early 2017 and we moved up to Chicago shortly thereafter. In September of 2018, I graduated from Northwestern University <small>***(GO WILDCATS!)***</small> with my **Masters of Science in Robotics** along with a cohort of nearly two dozen other incredible individuals. While studying at NU, I specialized in computer vision applications, 3D reconstruction, embedded systems programming *(a.k.a. working in [ROS](https://www.ros.org/))*, and robotic manipulation.

Part of my responsibilites to the MSR program led me to join the **[Computational Photography Lab](https://compphotolab.northwestern.edu/)** as a Research Scientist under Dr. Oliver Cossairt. For the several months I worked in the CPL, my main areas of focus involved working alongside Dr. Florian Willomitzer on an improved implementation of [Flying Triangulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4168) and on a novel use of `WebRTC` to facilitate surface measurements of [famous paintings](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2019/02/diagnosing-art-acne-in-georgia-okeeffe-paintings.html?utm_source=northwestern&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mccormick-alumni-enewsletter&utm_content=alumni__03-04-19_) and [stained glass works](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-28-7-9027) using consumer-grade electronic devices *(that's my hand holding the Android tablet in Figure 1a of the Optics Express article)*.

When I am not tinkering with robots or working on side projects, you can find me searching for new coffee shops and food spots, trying out a new board game, rock climbing, playing with my dog Luna, looking for interesting places to explore, swing dancing, reading a good book, or building things in *Factorio*.

Of course, I cannot hope to include everything in just this segment...but pictures may help fill in a few gaps:

Hi! My name is William Spies and I am currently based out of Chicago, IL. I consider myself both a full-time explorer and full-time engineer. I am currently attending Northwestern University (_GO WILDCATS!_) in the accelerated **[MSR (Masters of Science in Robotics)](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/)** program. When not in class or working on side projects, you can find me spending my free time listening to [Dan Carlin](http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/), finding new coffee shops, playing board games, studying architecture and cartography, swing-dancing, and visiting the lake shore. I am expected to graduate in the latter half of 2018.

For more on my background, I graduated from the University of Cincinnati (_GO BEARCATS!_) in 2012 with a **B.S. in Electrical Engineering** and a minor in Photonics. During my undergraduate tenure, I was privileged to be able to work on space-grade electronics while on a long co-op rotation with L-3 Communications Cincinnati Electronics. Otherwise, my time was spent serving as student liaison for the advisory council UC/Cincinnati Habitat for Humanity partnership and by showing leadership in engineering and interpersonal development in my community, most notably through volunteer efforts at the [Center for Community Engagement](https://www.uc.edu/cce.html).

Upon graduating, I accepted a full-time position in Columbus, OH, where I spent five years working as a leading **electrical design engineer**, **systems programmer**, and **systems project engineer**. My work portfolio carries the (very cool) distinction of being responsible for aspects of automated industrial systems currently in use at companies such as General Motors, Dow Chemical, Oral-B, Tesla Motors, First Solar, and various other enterprises. I was given many opportunities to work on fully-automated, robotic-arm-using industrial assembly systems, and that fact plays a crucial role in where I find myself today. While in Columbus, I spent a great deal of time at the [Columbus Idea Foundry](https://ideafoundry.com/), and consider them to be an incredible up-and-coming force for creativity and entrepreneurship.

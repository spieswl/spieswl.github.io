William Spies is an aspiring Roboticist and Research Scientist currently serving in the Computational Photography Lab at Northwestern University. Since joining the lab, under the guidance of Dr. Oliver Cossairt and Dr. Florian Willomitzer, he has been focusing on two practical applications of computer vision for scientific data collection. One project is the development of a computer vision framework for metrology applications, while the other is a 3D reconstruction system using machine vision cameras and programmed in C++.

In September of 2018, he graduated from Northwestern University (GO WILDCATS!) with his **Masters of Science in Robotics** from the accelerated **[MSR](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/)** program. While studying, he specialized in computer vision applications, 3d reconstruction and point cloud management, embedded systems programming, and parallel programming methods (whether through vectorization or bulk compute via GPUs).

Prior to his graduate studies, William was a **systems project engineer**, **systems programmer**, and **leading electrical engineer** with ATS Automation Tooling Systems in Columbus, OH. His project portfolio carries the distinction of delivering automated industrial systems currently in use at companies such as General Motors, Dow Chemical, Oral-B, Tesla Motors, First Solar, and various other enterprises. At the time of his acceptance to Northwestern in 2017, he had celebrated his 5th year at ATS, and was leading a team of a dozen systems programmers with over 100 years of programming experience. He was given several opportunities to work on fully-automated, robotic-arm-swinging industrial assembly systems, and those experiences served as crucial stepping stones to where he finds himself today. While in Columbus, he spent a great deal of time at the [Columbus Idea Foundry](https://ideafoundry.com/), and he considers them to be an incredible up-and-coming force for creativity, mischief, and entrepreneurship.

He graduated from the University of Cincinnati (GO BEARCATS!) with his **Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering** in June of 2012, along with a minor in Photonics. Along the way, he was privileged to support the engineering of space electronics while on co-op with L-3 Communications Cincinnati Electronics. He spent his free time serving as part of a partnership between Habitat for Humanity and the University of Cincinnati, and took opportunities to show leadership in engineering and interpersonal development in his community through the **[University Honors Program](https://www.uc.edu/honors.html)** and the **[Center for Community Engagement](https://www.uc.edu/cce.html)**.

He originally hails from Cincinnati, OH, and he misses quite a lot about his hometown...although he still prefers _Graeter's_ above _Aglamesis Brothers_. üç¶ When not in the lab or working on side projects, you can find him searching out new coffee shops and food spots, playing board games, looking for interesting architecture, swing dancing, and visiting the lake shore with his incredible wife.

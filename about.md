Hi! My name is William Spies and I am currently based out of Chicago, IL. I consider myself both a full-time explorer and full-time engineer. I am currently attending Northwestern University (_GO WILDCATS!_) in the accelerated **[MSR (Masters of Science in Robotics)](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/)** program. When not in class or working on side projects, you can find me spending my free time listening to [Dan Carlin of Hardcore History fame](http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/), finding new coffee shops, playing board games, studying architecture and cartography, swing dancing, and visiting the lake shore. I am expected to graduate in the latter half of 2018.

For more on my background, I graduated from the University of Cincinnati (_GO BEARCATS!_) in 2012 with a **B.S. in Electrical Engineering** and a **minor in Photonics**. During my undergraduate tenure, I was privileged to be able to work on space-grade electronics while on a multi-year co-op assignment with L-3 Communications Cincinnati Electronics. When not in class or at work, my time was spent serving multiple communities around UC. I served as student liaison to the advisory council overseeing a UC/Cincinnati **Habitat for Humanity** partnership. I also demonstrated leadership both in engineering and in the broader community, most notably through volunteer efforts at the [Center for Community Engagement](https://www.uc.edu/cce.html) where I lived as an early undergrad and later served as Resident Advisor in my final year.

Upon graduating, I accepted a full-time position in Columbus, OH, where I spent five years working as a leading **electrical design engineer**, **systems programmer**, and **systems project engineer**. My work portfolio carries the (extremely cool) distinction of being responsible for the control systems of automated industrial manufacturing systems currently in use at companies such as General Motors, Dow Chemical, Oral-B, Tesla Motors, First Solar, and various other enterprises. I was given many opportunities to work on fully-automated, robotic-arm-swinging, industrial assembly systems, and that experience served as a crucial stepping stone to where I find myself today. While in Columbus, I spent a great deal of time at the [Columbus Idea Foundry](https://ideafoundry.com/), and consider them to be an incredible up-and-coming force for creativity, mischief, and entrepreneurship.
